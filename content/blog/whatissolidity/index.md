title: What is Solidity?

Solidity is an object-oriented, high-level language for implementing smart contracts. 
Smart contracts are programs which govern the behaviour of accounts within the Ethereum state([1](https://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/v0.5.2/ "Solidity docs")).

# Why Solidity and not something else?

Theoretically any programming language being Turing complete can do what the other languages do. 
But the reality is that you as a developer won't use just a programming language to do everything, but you will learn many different languages depending on your needs.
You will find out that Python is very popular in the data science environment, Ruby in the web development space and so on.

Solidity is the most popular language in the Ethereum space. You are not going to find conventional languages because of a few reasons:

1) Memory usage -> You want to run as cheaply as possible, something that conventional languages do not take into consideration.
2) Garbage collection ->  Not ideal compared to what is necessary in the blockchain space.

## Yes, but why Solidity and not Vyper, LLL, etc.?

Because right now it's the most popular one, alternatives are growing, but they are not at the same level of maturity as of now.
