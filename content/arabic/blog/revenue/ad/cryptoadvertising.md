So, you decided to make money from your website or app and the first thing that comes to your money are ads.
They existed before cryptos were even a thing and they are one of the biggest ways to get a revenue, but which one to choose?

There some aspects that I'm going to illustrate in order to get a first impression about your possibilities:

CPM ->cost per mille -> which means that every thousand views you will get that *cost* payed by an advertiser; generally more popular.
CPC -> cost per click -> which means that for every click you will get that *cost* payed by an advertiser; generally less popular.

In order to get accepted in the majority of these ad networks you need to be talk about finance/cryptos.

## Cointraffic

Born in 2013 and one the most popular crypto advertising networks, it offers banner ads, native ads, full marketing and press releases.
It is based in Estonia.

 Minimum requirements:

 * Your website has to be related to the cryptocurrency market.
 * Your website must ensure brand-safe content including unique and original articles as well as a user-friendly interface.
 * Your website must have a minimum unique visitor per month rate of 10,000 and above.

CPM: It should be between 0.5&euro; and 12&euro;, referenced by this [image](https://cointraffic.io/img/main/network/price.png "Cointraffic reference image").

Calculation is based on these factors: 

* The advertising format – what types of banners or formats are being used?
* Quality of website traffic.
* GEO settings.
* Website thematic.

CPC & Referral: They do not support these models.

Payment:

* Minimum payment is 25&euro; and there is not maximum, so as much as you want.
* Accumulated commissions are received in euro (EUR) and payments made in Bitcoins (BTC) to your BTC wallet address. *Remember this is based on european country (Estonia) *
* As soon as your account reaches the minimum payment threshold you will be notified – you can then choose to submit a payment request with payments made in several working days.

Cointraffic allows website and mobile ads.

Two of the biggest publishers listed publishers are CoinMarketCap and CoinGecko.

## Coinzilla

Coinzilla offers the possibility to use different ad formats, but it's not very clear if you can implement these ads on both apps and websites. *So I'm gonna ask them and then I will let you know*

CPM & CPC: It's not very clear how much you can get, they say their rates depends on website design, content quality, and more.

Minimum amount that you can withdraw is 50&euro; and you don't have any fees to withdraw. The rate of conversion between the gained BTC/ETH and EUR depends on [Kraken](https://www.kraken.com/ "Kraken").

Many websites say that they are very picky on who can become a publisher considering the website amount of views, but on their website I couldn't find anything to back that up.
